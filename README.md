UML - I drew three diagrams. First is the d-Diagram about Library Management. The second is Class-diagram. I drew all the classes and functions that I used. The last one is the User information inquiry Sequence Diagram. It's a diagram of the Sequence of the user and the database. https://github.com/john2417/SE/tree/c3bb83e1190b5ce0262e4bc65d8af7e51f50f3d4/UML

DDD - I have brainstormed with the events in the Library. And changed the events into certain domains and put them into the Core domain chart. With those domains, I have made a relationship domain diagram.
