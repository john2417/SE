Git - I have used git. And made three branches. https://github.com/john2417/SE.git

UML - I drew three diagrams. First is the d-Diagram about Library Management. The second is Class-diagram. I drew all the classes and functions that I used. The last one is the User information inquiry Sequence Diagram. It's a diagram of the Sequence of the user and the database. [UML](https://github.com/john2417/SE/tree/c3bb83e1190b5ce0262e4bc65d8af7e51f50f3d4/UML)

DDD - I have brainstormed with the events in the Library. And changed the events into certain domains and put them into the Core domain chart. With those domains, I have made a relationship domain diagram. [DDD](https://github.com/john2417/SE/tree/3fe00b112a58c6d70e412f7f1e74ff79206db453/DDD)
Metrics - I have used Sonarqube and pylint. My code was written in Python so I have to use them. There is a screenshot of Sonarqube and Pylint. And project zip file of Sonarqube. [Metrics](https://github.com/john2417/SE/tree/3fe00b112a58c6d70e412f7f1e74ff79206db453/Metrics)
